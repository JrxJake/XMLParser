# XMLParser
Parses XML file to determine the leaf nodes in the XML Element Tree, then draws a yellow rectangle around each of them.

It is a python file, so it is compiled automatically. Assuming you have Python downloaded, simply run the python file and input the title/extension of the XML/PNG pair you want to analyse.
